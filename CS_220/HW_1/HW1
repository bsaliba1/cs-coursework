                w=y;
                s_sum=x+y;
                u_sum=v+w;
                printf("Signed: %d + %d = %d\n",x,y,s_sum);
                printf("Unsigned: %u + %u = %u\n",v,w,u_sum);
                if (s_sum==u_sum) { printf("The result matches\n"); }
                else { printf("The result is different\n"); }
                return 0;
        }       
        
   Then invoke the resulting program, specifying two numbers as command line
   arguments.

   Can you run this program with any arguments that ends up printing "The
   results are different"?
  
  
   Can you figure out why?
        No there are no combinations of numbers that will result in a different
        result. This is because s_sum and u_sum will always have the same value(        bitwise), the only difference is that s_sum is a signed integer and u_su        m is an unsigned integer and when comparing them with "==" it compares          the value in bits.
