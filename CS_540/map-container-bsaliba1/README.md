## **Notes:**
#### - Everything appears to be working; however, an issue arises at the 38th iteration of the stress test for test1. I was unable to solve this issue.
#### - This map is indexable.
#### - I have provided my own test file under the name my_test.cpp. It tests all of the functions and iterator methods. It can be compiled with a simple `g++ my_test.cpp`
