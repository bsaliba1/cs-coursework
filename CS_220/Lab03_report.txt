CS-220 Spring 2018	Lab-03			Due Feb 06, 2018

1. The acronym "GDB" normally stands for "Gnu DeBugger", but according to the
   hunt the Wumpus Emperor, what does the acronym "GDB" stand for?
- Grandiose Destroyer of Bulldroppings
   
2. During this lab, what was the most useful gdb sub-command you discovered?
	
-The checkpoint command was extremely helpful for restoring/restarting to previous checkpoint before you die.


3. Is it possible to use gdb to prevent the message "You're dead." from getting
   printed, but instead of printing the message, cause the program to get
   restarted from the beginning automatically?  If so, what gdb sub-commands 
   did you use to make this happen?
   
-You can use a checkpoint before the break killPlayer and restore to that checkpoint as a command for break killPlayer and this will restore back to before you died and avoid the "You're dead" string.

4. The wumpus moves around the maze randomly, and kills a player if it ends up
   in the same room as the player. Is there any way in gdb to move the wumpus
   to a different room before he has a chance to kill you? If so, what gdb
   sub-commands would you use to move the wumpus?
-You can change the wumpus' location by setting the wumpusCol and wumpusRow right before you move
   
5. Do you have any suggestions to make the wumpus game more fun or more
   interesting?
-Making the map bigger and having a GUI map on the side would make it a lot of fun
