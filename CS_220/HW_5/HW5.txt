CS-220 Spring 2018 Homework 5			Due: Mar. 18, 2018

1. Given the C expression: float x=-19.625; 

	A. What is the value for the sign bit of x?
	    - 1
	B. What is the binary representation of 19.625, using a binary point
	   instead of a decimal point?
	    - 10011.101
	C. What is the representation of 19.625 in normalized binary scientific
	   notation?
	    - 1.0011101 *2^4 
	D. What is the unbiased value of the exponent in the C representation?
	    - 4
	E. What is the biased value of the exponent in the C representation of
	   19.625?
	    - 131
	F. What are the concrete fraction bits in the binary representation of x?
	    - 00111010000000000000000  
	G. What is the hexadecimal concrete representation of x?
	    - 419d0000
2. Given the following code:

	union flint { 
		float xf;
		unsigned int xi;
	} fl;
	fl.xi=0x42c8000;
	printf("xf=%.3f\n",fl.xf);
	
	What will get printed to standard output?
	When I tried to run this, I got xf=0.000. However,I'm not sure if that's what you expected. I think what was expected was xf = 100.000 because when interpreting ox42c8000 as a float it would interpret it as 100.000.
