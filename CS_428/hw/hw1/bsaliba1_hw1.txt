Problem 1.
    a) d_prop = m/s
    b) d_trans = L/R
    c) d_nodal = d_prop + d_trans = m/s + L/R
    d) The last bit will have just have started to propogate to host B. It will just have been transmitted onto the wire.
    e) The first bit will be on the wire being sent to host B but will not have arrived yet
    f) The first bit will have already arrived at host B.
    g) m = (0.12*(2.5*10^8))/56 = 535714m
